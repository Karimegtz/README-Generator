# README Generator

## Description

The **README Generator** is a command-line application that allows developers to quickly generate a professional README.md file for their projects. By using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4), the application prompts the user for key information about their project and then generates a complete README.md with sections such as Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, License, and Questions.
